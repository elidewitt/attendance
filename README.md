# attendance
This is the code created by me. It is deployed on a raspberry pi with the relevant libraries installed. It functions by connecting to a google sheet with three spreadsheets. One with a list of members and their IDs. One with a list of people currently clocked in and other relevant information, with the last one being a log of all shifts clocked.
